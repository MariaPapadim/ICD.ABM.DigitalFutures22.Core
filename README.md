Source code and Grasshopper implementation of ABxM Principal Strips. 

## Abstract
The principal curvature (PC) of a freeform surface, as an important indicator of its fundamental features, is frequently used in guiding their rationalization in the field of architectural geometry. The division of a surface using its PC lines into principal strips (PS) is an innovative way to break down a freeform surface for construction. However, the application of PC networks in architectural design is hindered by how difficult it is to generate them and flexibly control their density. This paper introduces an architect/designer-friendly method  for PS-based reconstruction of freeform surfaces with different umbilical conditions. An Agent-based Modelling (ABM) approach is developed to increase the degree of control over the principal curvature linesâ€™ density. Then a PS unfold method based on purely geometric operations is proposed to facilitate the production of strips using planar materials. This research can effectively expand the application range of PS-based surface reconstruction methods for freeform architectures.
